Roll a ball game

I have developed a roll a ball game in Unity. The ball is on a plane platform which has walls on all 4 sides. The ball has a rigidbody component and 
is affected by gravity which causes it to fall onto the plane at the beginning of the game. The rigidbody component also causes it to collide with
the walls.

Materials are used to add colour to the walls and the ball itself.
